Importnce of Ansible

Provisoning, Configration management, App Deployment

Main configration file of Ansible here you can list all your servers 
/etc/ansible/hosts

Good practise to take backup of hostfile before doing modifications


Launch a Instance Redhat or CentOS linux in Amazon console

dont switch to root user do practise in as  local user only


check the epel repository is avilable in the redhat repository
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
ls

install wget : Yum install wget   If gets any error please restart the machine

Download epel rpm
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
ls *.rpm

Install epel
sudo yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

List your new repos
sudo yum repolist

Install Ansible

sudo yum install ansible -y
ansible --version

configration files location

cd /etc/ansible

configration file :  here you have the lots of information about the Ansible

more ansible.cfg


uncomment the below in the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg   so you can see the logs what is going on backend

log_path = /var/log/ansible.log


check python installed or not

sudo yum list installed | grep -i python

check python version

python
 
and press X to exit from the command

Take backup of hosts file to list your own servers like below

sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

you can add number of groups like below after IP you will update the pem file location as user like below

[server lists]

xx.xx.xx.xx
EX : 34.232.4.81      ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/WAC-Reports.pem

[webserver]
xx.xx.xx.xx
EX : 34.232.4.81      ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/WAC-Reports.pem

[App servers]

xx.xx.xx.xx
EX : 34.232.4.81      ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/WAC-Reports.pem


create file like server.pem and copy the pem file in your instance

ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/server.pem


vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
host_key_checking = False


Now installation and Configration DONE !!! try to run the below command to check

ansible [rkserver] -m ping   (square bracketrs not required while running the command)

if unable to connect please check the ssh access manually 

ssh -i /home/ec2-user/server.pem ec2-user@13.126.135.250

still unable to connect please check the node servers SG. in the SG master server should be allowed



ansible [rkserver] -m ping   (square bracketrs not required while running the command)
